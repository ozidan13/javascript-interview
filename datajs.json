  "question": "What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript",
  "answer": "There are many ways to create objects in javascript as mentioned below:\n\n   1. **Object literal syntax:**\n\n      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = {\n           name: \"Sudheer\",\n           age: 34\n      };\n      ```\n\n      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.\n\n      **Note:** This is one of the easiest ways to create an object.\n\n   2. **Object constructor:**\n\n      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the `Object` constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new Object();\n      ```\n\n      The `Object()` is a built-in constructor function so \"new\" keyword is not required. The above code snippet can be re-written as:\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object();\n      ```\n\n   3. **Object's create method:**\n\n      The `create` method of Object is used to create a new object by passing the specified prototype object and properties as arguments, i.e., this pattern is helpful to create new objects based on existing objects.\n      The second argument is optional and it is used to create properties on a newly created object.\n\n      The following code creates a new empty object whose prototype is null.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = Object.create(null);\n      ```\n      The following example creates an object along with additional new properties.\n\n      ```javascript\n      let vehicle = {\n        wheels: '4',\n        fuelType: 'Gasoline',\n        color: 'Green'\n      }\n      let carProps = {\n        type: {\n          value: 'Volkswagen'\n        },\n        model: {\n          value: 'Golf'\n        }\n      }\n\n      var car = Object.create(vehicle, carProps);\n      console.log(car);\n      ```\n\n   4. **Function constructor:**\n\n      In this approach, create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function Person(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.age = 21;\n      }\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n\n   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**\n\n      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,\n\n      ```javascript\n      function Person() {}\n      Person.prototype.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      var object = new Person();\n      ```\n\n      This is equivalent to creating an instance with Object.create method with a function prototype and then calling that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.\n\n      ```javascript\n      function func() {}\n\n      new func(x, y, z);\n      ```\n\n      **(OR)**\n\n      ```javascript\n      // Create a new instance using function prototype.\n      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)\n\n      // Call the function\n      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),\n\n      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.\n      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);\n      ```\n   6. **Object's assign method:**\n\n      The `Object.assign` method is used to copy all the properties from one or more source objects and stores them into a target object.\n\n      The following code creates a new staff object by copying properties of his working company and the car he owns.\n\n      ```javascript\n      const orgObject = { company: 'XYZ Corp'};\n      const carObject = { name: 'Toyota'};\n      const staff = Object.assign({}, orgObject, carObject);\n      ```\n\n   7. **ES6 Class syntax:**\n\n      ES6 introduces class feature to create objects.\n\n      ```javascript\n      class Person {\n        constructor(name) {\n          this.name = name;\n        }\n      }\n\n      var object = new Person(\"Sudheer\");\n      ```\n\n   8. **Singleton pattern:**\n\n      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.\n\n      ```javascript\n      var object = new (function () {\n        this.name = \"Sudheer\";\n      })();\n      ```"

  "question": "What is a prototype chain",
  "answer": "**Prototype chaining** is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.\n\n   The prototype on object instance is available through **Object.getPrototypeOf(object)** or **\\_\\_proto\\_\\_** property whereas prototype on constructor function is available through **Object.prototype**.\n\n   ![Screenshot](images/prototype_chain.png)"

  "question": "What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind",
  "answer": "The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,\n\n   **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   invite.call(employee1, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.call(employee2, \"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   **Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   invite.apply(employee1, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   invite.apply(employee2, [\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   **Bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments\n\n   ```javascript\n   var employee1 = { firstName: \"John\", lastName: \"Rodson\" };\n   var employee2 = { firstName: \"Jimmy\", lastName: \"Baily\" };\n\n   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {\n     console.log(\n       greeting1 + \" \" + this.firstName + \" \" + this.lastName + \", \" + greeting2\n     );\n   }\n\n   var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);\n   var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);\n   inviteEmployee1(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?\n   inviteEmployee2(\"Hello\", \"How are you?\"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?\n   ```\n\n   Call and Apply are pretty much interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.\n\n   Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind()."

  "question": "What is JSON and its common operations",
  "answer": "**JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network. It is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json\n\n   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object\n\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.parse(text);\n   ```\n\n   **Stringification:** Converting a native object to a string so that it can be transmitted across the network\n\n   ```javascript\n   JSON.stringify(object);\n   ```"

  "question": "What is the purpose of the array slice method",
  "answer": "The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end of the array. This method can also accept negative index which counts back from the end of the array.\n\n   Some of the examples of this method are,\n\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]\n   let arrayIntegers4 = arrayIntegers.slice(-3, -1); //returns [3, 4]\n   ```\n\n   **Note:** Slice method doesn't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array."

{
  "id": 6,
  "question": "What is the purpose of the array splice method",
  "answer": "The **splice()** method adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position/index for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.\n\n   Some of the examples of this method are:\n\n   ```javascript\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]\n   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]\n   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", 5]\n   ```\n\n   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array."

  "question": "How do you compare Object and Map",
  "answer": "**Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases:\n\n   1. The keys of an Object can be Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive type.\n   2. The keys in a Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in the order of insertion.\n   3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.\n   4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.\n   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in an object that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by creating an object(which can be called a map) using `Object.create(null)`, but this practice is seldom done.\n   6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs."

  "question": "What is the difference between == and === operators",
  "answer": "JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,\n\n   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.\n   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal, i.e., having the same number value.\n      There are two special cases in this,\n      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.\n      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.\n   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.\n   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.\n   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with == .\n      i.e, `null===undefined --> false`, but `null==undefined --> true`\n\n   Some of the example which covers the above cases:\n\n   ```javascript\n   0 == false   // true\n   0 === false  // false\n   1 == \"1\"     // true\n   1 === \"1\"    // false\n   null == undefined // true\n   null === undefined // false\n   '0' == false // true\n   '0' === false // false\n   NaN == NaN or NaN === NaN // false\n   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory\n   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory\n   ```"

  "question": "What are lambda expressions or arrow functions",
  "answer": "An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.\n\n    Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,\n    ```javascript\n    const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters\n    const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10; // Single parameter\n    const arrowFunc3 = () => {} // no parameters\n    ```"

  "question": "What is a first class function",
  "answer": "In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.\n\n    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener\n\n    ```javascript\n    const handler = () => console.log(\"This is a click handler function\");\n    document.addEventListener(\"click\", handler);\n    ```"

{
  "id": 13,
  "question": "What is a higher order function",
  "answer": "A higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.\n    The syntactic structure of higher order function will be as follows,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const firstOrderFunc = () =>\n      console.log(\"Hello, I am a First order function\");\n    const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();\n    higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);\n    ```\n    You can also call the function which you are passing to higher order function as callback function.\n\n    The higher order function is helpful to write the modular and reusable code."

  "question": "What is the currying function",
  "answer": "Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, an n-ary function turns into a unary function.\n\n    Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6\n\n    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;\n    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c\n    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6\n    ```\n\n    Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**."

{
  "id": 16,
  "question": "What is a pure function",
  "answer": "A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.\n\n    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,\n\n    ```javascript\n    //Impure\n    let numberArray = [];\n    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);\n    //Pure\n    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>\n      argNumberArray.concat([number]);\n\n    //Display the results\n    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]\n    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]\n    ```\n\n    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value, whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.\n\n    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with the **Immutability** concept of ES6: giving preference to **const** over **let** usage."

  "question": "What is the purpose of the let keyword",
  "answer": "The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.\n\n    Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,\n\n    ```javascript\n    let counter = 30;\n    if (counter === 30) {\n      let counter = 31;\n      console.log(counter); // 31\n    }\n    console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)\n    ```"

  "question": "What is memoization",
  "answer": "Memoization is a functional programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.\n    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,\n\n    ```javascript\n    const memoizeAddition = () => {\n      let cache = {};\n      return (value) => {\n        if (value in cache) {\n          console.log(\"Fetching from cache\");\n          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.\n        } else {\n          console.log(\"Calculating result\");\n          let result = value + 20;\n          cache[value] = result;\n          return result;\n        }\n      };\n    };\n    // returned function from memoizeAddition\n    const addition = memoizeAddition();\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated\n    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached\n    ```"

  "question": "What is Hoisting",
  "answer": "Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.\n    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(message); //output : undefined\n    var message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n\n    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,\n\n    ```javascript\n    var message;\n    console.log(message);\n    message = \"The variable Has been hoisted\";\n    ```\n\n    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too\n\n    ```javascript\n    message(\"Good morning\"); //Good morning\n\n    function message(name) {\n      console.log(name);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared."

  "question": "What are classes in ES6",
  "answer": "In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.\n    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Bike(model, color) {\n      this.model = model;\n      this.color = color;\n    }\n\n    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {\n      return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n    };\n    ```\n\n    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative\n\n    ```javascript\n    class Bike {\n      constructor(color, model) {\n        this.color = color;\n        this.model = model;\n      }\n\n      getDetails() {\n        return this.model + \" bike has\" + this.color + \" color\";\n      }\n    }\n    ```"

  "question": "What are closures",
  "answer": "A closure is the combination of a function bundled(enclosed) together with its lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables, functions and other data even after the outer function has finished its execution. The closure has three scope chains.\n\n    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets\n    2. Outer function's variables\n    3. Global variables\n\n    Let's take an example of closure concept,\n\n    ```javascript\n    function Welcome(name) {\n      var greetingInfo = function (message) {\n        console.log(message + \" \" + name);\n      };\n      return greetingInfo;\n    }\n    var myFunction = Welcome(\"John\");\n    myFunction(\"Welcome \"); //Output: Welcome John\n    myFunction(\"Hello Mr.\"); //output: Hello Mr. John\n    ```\n\n    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned."

},
{
  "id": 33,
  "question": "How do you reuse information across service worker restarts",
  "answer": "The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts."

Terminate a Web Worker:\n       Web workers will continue to listen for messages (even after the external script is finished) until it is terminated. You can use the terminate() method to terminate listening to the messages.\n\n    ```javascript\n    w.terminate();\n    ```\n\n    4.

  "question": "Why do we need callbacks",
  "answer": "The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response, javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.\n    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.\n\n    ```javascript\n    function firstFunction() {\n      // Simulate a code delay\n      setTimeout(function () {\n        console.log(\"First function called\");\n      }, 1000);\n    }\n    function secondFunction() {\n      console.log(\"Second function called\");\n    }\n    firstFunction();\n    secondFunction();\n\n    // Output:\n    // Second function called\n    // First function called\n    ```\n\n    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed.

This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `\"use strict\";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode. This also enables block-scoped variables."
},
{
  "id": 67,
  "question": "Why do you need strict mode",
  "answer": "Strict mode is useful to write \"secure\" JavaScript by notifying \"bad syntax\" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object."
},
{
  "id": 68,
  "question": "How do you declare strict mode",
  "answer": "The strict mode is declared by adding \"use strict\"; to the beginning of a script or a function.\n    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.\n\n    ```javascript\n    \"use strict\";\n    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared\n    ```\n\n    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope\n\n    ```javascript\n    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.\n    myFunction();\n\n    function myFunction() {\n      \"use strict\";\n      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error\n    }\n    ```"

  "question": "What is the purpose of double exclamation",
  "answer": "The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.\n    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,\n\n    ```javascript\n    let isIE8 = false;\n    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);\n    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false\n    ```\n\n    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null\n    ```\n\n    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator."

  "question": "How do you check whether a string contains a substring",
  "answer": "There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,\n\n     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       subString = \"hell\";\n     mainString.includes(subString);\n     ```\n\n     2. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       subString = \"hell\";\n     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;\n     ```\n\n     3. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions\n\n     ```javascript\n     var mainString = \"hello\",\n       regex = /hell/;\n     regex.test(mainString);\n     ```"

  "question": "How do you check if a key exists in an object",
  "answer": "You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,\n\n     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not\n\n        ```javascript\n        \"key\" in obj;\n        ```\n\n        and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,\n\n        ```javascript\n        !(\"key\" in obj);\n        ```\n\n     2. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)\n\n        ```javascript\n        obj.hasOwnProperty(\"key\"); // true\n        ```\n\n     3. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.\n\n        ```javascript\n        const user = {\n          name: \"John\",\n        };\n\n        console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true\n        console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false\n        ```"

  "question": "What is tree shaking",
  "answer": "Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`."
},
{
  "id": 152,
  "question": "What is the need of tree shaking",
  "answer": "Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers."

  "question": "What are the string methods that accept Regular expression",
  "answer": "There are six string methods: search(), replace(), replaceAll(), match(), matchAll(), and split().\n\n     The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6\n     ```\n\n     The replace() and replaceAll() methods are used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"ball bat\";\n     var n1 = msg.replace(/b/i, \"c\"); // call bat\n     var n2 = msg.replaceAll(/b/i, \"c\"); // call cat\n     ```\n\n     The match() and matchAll() methods are used to return the matches when matching a string against a regular expression.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n1 = msg.match(/[A-Z]/g); // [\"H\", \"J\"]\n     var n2 = msg.matchAll(/[A-Z]/g); // this returns an iterator\n     ```\n\n     The split() method is used to split a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.\n\n     ```javascript\n     var msg = \"Hello John\";\n     var n = msg.split(/\\s/); // [\"Hello\", \"John\"]\n     ```"

[abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)\n        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets\n        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |\n     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning.\n        For example, below are some use cases,\n        1. \\\\d: Used to find a digit\n        2. \\\\s: Used to find a whitespace character\n        3. \\\\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word\n     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities.\n        For example, below are some use cases,\n        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n\n        2. n\\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n\n        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n"

  "question": "How does synchronous iteration works",
  "answer": "Synchronous iteration was introduced in ES6 and it works with below set of components,\n\n     **Iterable:** It is an object which can be iterated over via a method whose key is Symbol.iterator.\n\n     **Iterator:** It is an object returned by invoking `[Symbol.iterator]()` on an iterable. This iterator object wraps each iterated element in an object and returns it via `next()` method one by one.\n\n     **IteratorResult:** It is an object returned by `next()` method. The object contains two properties; the `value` property contains an iterated element and the `done` property determines whether the element is the last element or not.\n\n     Let's demonstrate synchronous iteration with an array as below,\n\n     ```javascript\n     const iterable = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"];\n     const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'one', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'two', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'three', done: false }\n     console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 'undefined, done: true }\n     ```"

  "question": "What is an event loop",
  "answer": "The event loop is a process that continuously monitors both the call stack and the event queue and checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If the call stack is empty and there are pending events in the event queue, the event loop dequeues the event from the event queue and pushes it to the call stack. The call stack executes the event, and any additional events generated during the execution are added to the end of the event queue.\n\n     **Note:** The event loop allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded, by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible. Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background."
},
{
  "id": 237,
  "question": "What is call stack",
  "answer": "Call Stack is a data structure for javascript interpreters to keep track of function calls(creates execution context) in the program. It has two major actions,\n\n     1. Whenever you call a function for its execution, you are pushing it to the stack.\n     2. Whenever the execution is completed, the function is popped out of the stack.\n\n     Let's take an example and it's state representation in a diagram format\n\n     ```javascript\n     function hungry() {\n       eatFruits();\n     }\n     function eatFruits() {\n       return \"I'm eating fruits\";\n     }\n\n     // Invoke the `hungry` function\n     hungry();\n     ```\n\n     The above code processed in a call stack as below,\n\n     3. Add the `hungry()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n     4. Add the `eatFruits()` function to the call stack list and execute the code.\n     5. Delete the `eatFruits()` function from our call stack list.\n     6. Delete the `hungry()` function from the call stack list since there are no items anymore.\n\n     ![Screenshot](images/call-stack.png)"

  "question": "What is an event queue",
  "answer": "The event queue follows the queue data structure. It stores async callbacks to be added to the call stack. It is also known as the Callback Queue or Macrotask Queue.\n\n     Whenever the call stack receives an async function, it is moved into the Web API. Based on the function, Web API executes it and awaits the result. Once it is finished, it moves the callback into the event queue (the callback of the promise is moved into the microtask queue).\n\n     The event loop constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty. Once the call stack is empty and there is a callback in the event queue, the event loop moves the callback into the call stack. But if there is a callback in the microtask queue as well, it is moved first. The microtask queue has a higher priority than the event queue."
